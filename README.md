# TiledAttentionCouple

_TiledAttentionCouple_ is a custom node for ComfyUI that enables _Attention Coupling_ across horizontal or vertical tiles. It allows fine(r)-grained control of prompts across different sections of the image. This is especially useful in scenarios where multiple subjects or themes need to coexist in an image without blending them.

2. Connect _Tiled Attention Couple (Impact Pack Detailer)_ to _FaceDetailer_ `detailer_hook`.

## Usage

_TiledAttentionCouple_ slices the image into horizontal or vertical tiles based on your chosen _division_ and _orientation_. The _division_ is a comma-seperated string representing each tile, where each number represents the relative size of that specific tile:

* `1,1` ‚Üí two equally-sized tiles.
* `1,2` ‚Üí two tiles, the second is twice as large as the first.
* `1,1,1` ‚Üí three equally-sized tiles.

The _orientation_ determines how the tiles are divided: _horizontal_ places tiles side by side (left to right), while _vertical_ stacks them on top of each other (top to bottom):

* `1,2` _horizontal_ ‚Üí bottom tile is twice as large as the top tile.
* `1,2` _vertical_ ‚Üí right tile is twice as large as the left tile.

Prompts start with a _common prompt_ that applies to the entire image. After this, you can add _tile prompts_ by separating them with the keyword `BREAK`. Each `BREAK` corresponds to a tile in sequential order, from left to right (for _horizontal_) or top to bottom (for _vertical_).
