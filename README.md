# TiledAttentionCouple

_TiledAttentionCouple_ is a custom node for ComfyUI that enables _Attention Coupling_ across horizontal or vertical tiles. It allows fine(r)-grained control of prompts across different sections of the image. This is especially useful in scenarios where multiple subjects or themes need to coexist in an image without blending them.

## Install

Navigate to your ComfyUI _custom_nodes_ directory:

    cd /path/to/comfyui/custom_nodes

Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/Deathspike/ComfyUI-TiledAttentionCouple

Restart ComfyUI to load the new nodes.

## Configuration

Follow these steps to integrate _Tiled Attention Couple_ into your workflow:

1. Replace positive and negative prompt with _Tiled Attention Couple (Prompt)_.
2. Add _Tiled Attention Couple_. Match `width` and `height` properties to output.
3. Connect _Tiled Attention Couple (Prompt)_ to _Tiled Attention Couple_.
4. Connect _Tiled Attention Couple_ with an input model and clip.
5. Use _Tiled Attention Couple_ output model and conditionings.

## Usage

_TiledAttentionCouple_ slices the image into horizontal or vertical tiles based on your chosen _division_ and _orientation_. The _division_ is a comma-seperated string representing each tile, where each number represents the relative size of that specific tile:

* `1,1` ‚Üí two equally-sized tiles.
* `1,2` ‚Üí two tiles, the second is twice as large as the first.
* `1,1,1` ‚Üí three equally-sized tiles.

The _orientation_ determines how the tiles are divided: _horizontal_ places tiles side by side (left to right), while _vertical_ stacks them on top of each other (top to bottom):

* `1,2` _horizontal_ ‚Üí bottom tile is twice as large as the top tile.
* `1,2` _vertical_ ‚Üí right tile is twice as large as the left tile.

Prompts start with a _common prompt_ that applies to the entire image. After this, you can add _tile prompts_ by separating them with the keyword `BREAK`. Each `BREAK` corresponds to a tile in sequential order, from left to right (for _horizontal_) or top to bottom (for _vertical_).
